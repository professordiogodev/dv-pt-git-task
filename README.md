# Git Task!

This is Diogo Feature #1

## All Collaborators must Do:

1. As a developer, I want to clone a repository from GitHub so that I can start working on the project locally.
Use git clone https://github.com/username/project.git to clone a repository you created.


2. As a developer, I want to create and switch to a new branch so that I can work on a feature without affecting the main project.
Create a new branch using git checkout -b feature-new-feature.
Work on the feature and commit changes to the new branch.

3. As a developer, I want to merge a feature branch into the main branch so that the new feature becomes part of the main project.
Push the feature branch to the remote repository.
Create a pull request for the feature branch on GitHub.
Merge the branch after code review.

4. As a developer, I want to resolve merge conflicts so that I can merge my work into the main project without issues.
Identify conflicting files using git status.
Manually resolve the conflicts in the files and commit the changes.

5. As a team member, I want to review a pull request so that I can ensure the code meets project standards.
Review the code in the pull request using GitHubâ€™s review system.
Provide feedback or approve the request.

6. As a developer, I want to push local changes to the remote repository so that other team members can access my work.
Use git add . and git commit -m "Added new feature" to commit changes.
Push the changes to the remote branch using git push origin feature-new-feature.

7. As a developer, I want to set up a .gitignore file so that unnecessary files are not tracked by Git.
Create a .gitignore file in the project directory.
Add entries for files such as node_modules/, .env, and log files.

8. As a developer, I want to rebase my branch onto the latest changes from the main branch so that I can avoid large merge conflicts later.
Fetch the latest changes using git fetch.
Rebase the feature branch using git rebase main to incorporate the latest changes.

9. As a developer, I want to tag a specific release in the repository so that I can mark important project milestones.
Create a tag using git tag -a v1.0 -m "First release".
Push the tag to the remote repository using git push origin v1.0.
